# _printf :page_facing_up:

`_print` is a custom recreation of the C standard library function `printf`. The project was completed to represent an application of knowledge that **ALX School** cohort of two students have learned since the starting of the program on June 8, 2022.

## Dependencies :couple:

The `_printf` function was coded on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS machine and compiled using `gcc` using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
